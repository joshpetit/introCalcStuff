I did my work for math 122 in latex. Complete mistake don't do that lol. I do recommend buying a cheap drawing tablet, [here's](https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Graphic-Drawing-Tablet-Beginners/dp/B07S1RR3FR/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=wacom&qid=1608509339&sr=8-4) 
one compatible with linux. Wacom tablets in cgeneral are good from what I hear. Don't waste your time guys lol.
